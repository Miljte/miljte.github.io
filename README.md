# hey, i'm miljte

welcome to my corner of the web. this is where i keep my thoughts, projects, and whatever i'm working on at the moment.

## what's here

**a minimal resume/cv** — the essentials about my experience, skills, and what i've built. clean layout, no fluff.

**built with modern tech** — next.js 16, react 19, tailwind, framer motion. it's fast, responsive, and actually looks good.

**thoughtful design** — not over-engineered. the site works on everything from your phone to a wide monitor. dark mode by default because, yeah.

## quick facts

- 🔧 i build things with **typescript, react, and node.js**
- 🎨 **design matters** — i care about how things feel, not just how they work
- 💭 always **learning** and shipping things (even if they're not perfect)
- 🚀 interests: **full-stack development, design systems, developer tools, and clean code**
